# 32-bit Binary-Coded Decimal adder
1. Design a 32-bit adder, which converts the binary inputs to decimal, adds, and converts the decimal sum back to binary.
2. Write a test bench for the ALU you have designed.
3. Upload the code to this folder.

#### Example:
**Input:** `A = 0101`  `B = 1001`
**Output:** `Y = 1 0100`
**Explanation:** Adding A(=5) and B(=9), the value of binary sum will be 1110(=14). 
But, the BCD sum will be 1 0100, where 1 is 0001 in binary and 4 is 0100 in binary.
