# N-bit Arithmetic and Logic Unit
1. Design a N-bit parameterised ALU, using structural style, with the following Op code table:

|Code|Operation|
|:--:|:-------:|
|00|A & B|
|01|A ^ B|
|10|A + B|
|11|A - B|

2. Write a self checking test bench for the ALU you have designed.
3. Upload the code to this folder.
